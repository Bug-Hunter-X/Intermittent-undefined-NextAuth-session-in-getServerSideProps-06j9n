# Intermittent undefined NextAuth session in getServerSideProps

This repository demonstrates a bug where the NextAuth session is intermittently undefined in `getServerSideProps` even though it's successfully fetched in the API route (`/api/auth/[...nextauth]`). This behavior is inconsistent and makes debugging challenging.

## Description
The `pages/about.js` file attempts to access the NextAuth session within `getServerSideProps`.  While the session is retrieved correctly in the API route, it sometimes returns undefined in `getServerSideProps`, leading to an unexpected rendering.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/about`. You may see the session correctly displayed, or you may see it as undefined.  Refresh the page multiple times to observe the inconsistency.

## Expected Behavior
The session should always be defined in `getServerSideProps` if it's successfully retrieved from the API route.

## Actual Behavior
The session is sometimes undefined in `getServerSideProps`, resulting in a broken UI.

## Possible Solutions
The solution might involve investigating the asynchronous nature of `getServerSideProps` and how it interacts with the session fetching process. A potential solution might be to add more robust error handling or retry mechanisms.
